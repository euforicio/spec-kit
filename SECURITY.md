Thanks for helping keep Euforicio projects safe for everyone.

# Security

Euforicio takes the security of Spec Kit and our other open source projects seriously, including all repositories under the Euforicio organization.

While we do not currently run a public bug bounty program, we will ensure that valid security findings are promptly triaged and addressed by the Euforicio maintainers.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Spec Kit or any repository maintained by Euforicio, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please use this repository's "Report a vulnerability" option under the Security tab to open a private advisory to the Euforicio maintainers. If you cannot access that feature, contact the maintainers using the contact information listed for this repository (e.g., in `CODEOWNERS` or the project profile).

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Policy

We support good-faith security research and coordinated disclosure. We will not pursue or support legal action against security researchers who report vulnerabilities to us in good faith.
