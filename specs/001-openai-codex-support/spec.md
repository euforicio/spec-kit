# Feature Specification: OpenAI Codex Native Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-openai-codex-support`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "openai codex support"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: Codex-native workflow, command system, context awareness
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using OpenAI Codex, I want to access the full specify workflow directly within Codex through natural language and slash commands, so I can maintain spec-driven development practices without switching between tools.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a project with specify installed, **When** I run `specify feature context codex`, **Then** AGENTS.md is created/updated and .codex/commands/ directory is populated
2. **Given** I'm in a project with AGENTS.md, **When** I start Codex, **Then** Codex automatically loads AGENTS.md and understands the slash command system
3. **Given** a command doesn't exist, **When** I use natural language like "create a spec for X", **Then** Codex recognizes the intent and executes the appropriate command
4. **Given** I'm working on a feature, **When** I type `/plan`, **Then** Codex reads .codex/commands/plan.md and executes the planning workflow
5. **Given** multiple command files exist, **When** I type a slash command, **Then** Codex finds and executes the matching command file from .codex/commands/

### Edge Cases
- What happens when .codex directory doesn't exist?
- How does system handle malformed command files?
- What happens when a command file references missing templates?
- How does system handle conflicting command names?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST extend `specify feature context` command to support codex as an agent type
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate or update AGENTS.md in project root (Codex's standard context file)
- **FR-003**: System MUST create .codex/commands/ directory with command files
- **FR-004**: AGENTS.md MUST include instructions for slash command recognition
- **FR-005**: Command files MUST contain executable instructions that Codex can follow
- **FR-006**: System MUST support natural language fallback when slash commands aren't used
- **FR-007**: Templates MUST be accessible via @ notation (e.g., @.codex/commands/)
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain specify workflow principles (spec ‚Üí plan ‚Üí tasks ‚Üí implement)
- **FR-009**: Commands MUST execute actual specify CLI commands and parse their output
- **FR-010**: System MUST support command chaining (e.g., "create and plan")
- **FR-011**: Each command file MUST be self-contained with clear execution steps
- **FR-012**: System MUST update AGENTS.md incrementally like other agent files

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Command File**: Markdown file containing instructions for a specific command
- **Context Directory**: Collection of templates and configuration files
- **Initialization Config**: Settings and mappings for Codex integration
- **Command Registry**: Mapping of slash commands to command files
